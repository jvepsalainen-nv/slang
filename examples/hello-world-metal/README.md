Slang "Hello World" Metal Example
==================================

This example shows how to use the Slang API to compile a simple
compute shader written in Slang into Metal Shading Language (MSL) and run it on Metal.

This example is a Metal version of the hello-world example, demonstrating the same
compute shader (adding two buffers element-wise) but using the Metal API instead of Vulkan.

**Note:** This example requires macOS and the Metal framework to run.
